    "| fnlwgt | drop | This feature is a sampling weight and does not provide useful information for the prediction task. It is better to drop it to avoid introducing noise. |\n",

    "| education.num | drop | This feature is highly correlated with the 'education' feature. |\n",

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
